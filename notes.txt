noexcept
- tells compiler this function won't throw exception
- terminate if do throw
why?
make compiler faster
for move operations so T doesnt fall back to copy

const T& (read-only alias to avoid accidental modification)

new = allocate + construct
delete = call destructor + free

operator new = allocate
operator delete = free

placement new = place element in allocated memory

shared_ptr
normal construction does two allocations - object and ref_count
make_shared does one single allocation

friend class to share private members

explicit keyword for single arg constructor to prevent accidental implicit conversion
shared_ptr<int> sp(cb);  //OK
shared_ptr<int> sp = cb; //cannot implicitly convert

return ref for operator=() allows chaining a=b=c
a=b -> a.operator=(b)

copy-and-swap for exception safety

iterator - pointer wrapper to support for loop
